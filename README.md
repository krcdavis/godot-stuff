Doign some stuff in Godot game engine

NOTE TO SELF: If you import a map and it's facing the wrong way, DO NOT try to fix it by rotating the root node. THIS BREAKS THINGS. Either manually rotate every node below the root one or just, you know, re-export the map with the proper roation.

Current effort: A turn-based monster battler ala Pokemon. Uploading this janky bugged version as a backup before I completely refactor it for a second time. Maybe even using a proper state machine...
