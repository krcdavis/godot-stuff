# godot-stuff
Doign some stuff in Godot game engine

The basics- file with all the basic stuff implemented in it, like moving your character around, walls and collisions, moving from room to room etc
Known problems:
- The "origin" of a Position3D does not actually correspond with its absolute position FECKIN FIXED YEAH BABY
- Snap player to floor when loading new room better
- Player object hops/skips when going down a slope, depending on script used
- Player object slowly descends a slope when moving back and forth on it, depending on script used
- Player just plain old slides slowly down a slope when not moving depending on script used

Particlings or whatever I called it- separate file to implemebt the exact setup I want for a thing with particles which will be merged into the main basics gamefile when done-ish
